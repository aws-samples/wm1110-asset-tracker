               Enables(y) or disables(n) the zephyr shell for the Asset Tracker.

config GNSS_SCAN_MODE_STATIC

        bool

        help
               When enabled, uses STATIC scan mode which performs longer scans
               (~30+ seconds) for better accuracy (10-50m).
               When disabled, uses MOBILE scan mode with multiple quick scans
               (~3-5 seconds each) optimized for moving objects.
               STATIC mode uses more power but provides better accuracy.
